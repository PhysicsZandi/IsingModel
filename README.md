# Simulation of the Ising model with networks

In this repository, you will find a python implementation of the Ising model and its network analysis. 

The possible lattices are
1. 1d;
2. 2d square, triangular and hexagonal.

The plots are
1. In [animation](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot/animation), you will find a gif animation of the lattice;
2. In [exact_solutions](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot/exact_solutions), you will find the theoretical exact solution computed numerically;
3. In [graph](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot/graph), you will find a plot of the graph;
4. In [phase_transition](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot/phase_transition), you will find all the phase transitions plots;
5. In [weighted_graph](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot/weighted_graph), you will find the weighted graph built from the two points correlation function.
