# Simulation of the Ising model with networks

In this repository, you will find a python implementation of the Ising model. The systems we study are 
1. 1d;
2. 2d square, triangular and hexagonal;
3. 4d hypercube.

In [plot_equilibrium](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot_equilibrium), you will find how all the plots about thermal equilibrium,
In [plot_phase_transition](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/plot_phase_transition), you will find how all the plots about phase transition.
