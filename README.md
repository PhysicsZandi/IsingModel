# Simulation of the Ising model with networks

In this repository, you will find a python implementation of the Ising model.

For a 100x100 squared lattice graph:

### Equilibrium

1. in [equilibrium](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/equilibrium), you will find how the system reaches the equilibrium configuration, via energy and magnetisation plots.

2. in [sequence](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/sequence), you will find how the system reaches the equilibrium configuration with short videos.

### Phase transition

3. in [phase_transition](https://github.com/PhysicsZandi/IsingModel/blob/main/phase_transition), you will find plots of mean energy, magnetisation, specific heat and susceptibility against temperature. Phase transitions features are highlighted: magnetisation as an order parameter; specific heat and susceptibility divergences at the critical temperature of 2.26.
